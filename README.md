# Spatial Crime Analysis in Mexico City

Geospatial analysis of crime in Mexico City using **network-based KDE** and **Getis-Ord Gi\***.  
This project generates **hotspot** and **coldspot** maps of robbery events, following a **network-constrained spatial analysis** approach.

## 🧩 Overview

This project analyzes the **spatial distribution of robbery crimes in Mexico City** using the **road network** as the primary spatial support. Through the use of:

- Road network analysis  
- Lixel-based segmentation  
- Graph representations  
- **Network-based Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**  
- **Getis-Ord Gi\*** statistic for hotspot and coldspot detection  

an **interactive dashboard** is developed to explore high-risk areas for the most common robbery categories:  
**public transportation robbery, street robbery, and business robbery** along Mexico City’s road network.

The main goal of this project is to provide a useful tool for:

- **Public policy design and evaluation**  
- **Security analytics, risk assessment, and urban planning**

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To develop a **geospatial digital tool** that:

- Collects, processes, and analyzes **road network data and robbery events**  
- Estimates the **concentration of criminal events along the road network**, rather than in continuous space  
- Identifies **high-risk street segments** using statistical methods (Getis-Ord Gi\*)  
- Enables **clear and accessible visualization** through an **interactive dashboard**

## 🧠 Context and Motivation

The study of crime and violence requires an **integrated perspective** that combines:

- Characteristics of the **urban environment**  
- The structure and connectivity of the **road network**

Instead of analyzing only point patterns, this project focuses on **where daily life actually takes place: streets and roads**. This allows for:

- More accurate **risk exposure estimation**  
- Detection of **crime corridors**  
- Evidence-based **urban safety and planning decisions**

Although this project has a primarily **exploratory and descriptive** focus, its structure allows for the future integration of explanatory variables that may help understand the factors associated with these spatial patterns.

For example: socio-economic indicators, population density, proximity to public transportation, urban infrastructure, police presence, among others.

## 🗺️ Road Network Analysis

The core of the project is the **road network of Mexico City**, built using:

- Data from **INEGI** (Mexico’s national statistics agency)

The network is preprocessed to:

- Homogenize topology  
- Prepare the data for lixel-based and graph-based analysis

---

## 📏 Lixels: Network Segmentation

Once cleaned, the network is divided into small, uniform segments called **lixels** (line + pixel).

### Why is this useful?

- Enables **fine-grained and homogeneous** analysis  
- Facilitates computing **crime densities per segment**  
- Improves localization of **where exactly crimes concentrate**

Each lixel becomes an individual analytical unit for risk estimation.

---

## 🔗 Graph Representation

The road network is also represented as a **graph**. This representation allows:

- Modeling **urban connectivity**  
- Understanding how phenomena **propagate through the network**  
- Integrating graph-based metrics (distances, accessibility, etc.)

---

## 📈 Network-based Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)

To analyze whether crimes concentrate in specific areas, this project uses **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**. However, instead of applying it to continuous space, it is applied:

> ✅ **Directly on the road network**, using lixels as the spatial support.

### What does KDE do here?

- Each robbery event generates a localized influence over the network  
- Overlapping influences increase the estimated density  
- The result is a **street-segment-level crime intensity map**

The method considers:

- **Bandwidth**: controls the size of the influence area  
- **Kernel type**: the Epanechnikov kernel is used because it:
  - Minimizes the **Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE)**  
  - Has **compact support**, reducing computational cost  

---

## 🔥 Hotspot Detection: Getis-Ord Gi\*

While KDE highlights areas with high concentrations, it does not indicate whether these patterns are **statistically significant** or could arise by chance.

To address this, the **Getis-Ord Gi\*** statistic is applied to the lixels to:

- Distinguish between visually dense areas  
- And those that are **statistically significant when compared to their neighbors**

The results are visualized as:

- 🔴 **Hot spots**: street segments with significantly high concentrations  
- 🔵 **Cold spots**: street segments with significantly low concentrations  

These outputs feed directly into the interactive dashboard for intuitive interpretation.
